FractalDataWorks Developer Kit - Feature Branch Merge Script (PowerShell)

USAGE:
    .\merge-features.ps1 [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -DryRun       Preview merges without executing
    -Help         Show this help message
    -SkipBuild    Skip build verification steps (faster, less safe)

DESCRIPTION:
    Safely merges feature branches into features/fractaldataworks in optimal order:
    1. feature/architectural-analysis (documentation)
    2. feature/comprehensive-docs (documentation)
    3. feature/complete-tests (test improvements)

    The script performs pre-flight checks, executes merges with verification,
    and provides rollback options if issues occur.

EXAMPLES:
    # Preview what will happen
    .\merge-features.ps1 -DryRun

    # Execute merges with full verification
    .\merge-features.ps1

    # Execute merges without build checks (faster)
    .\merge-features.ps1 -SkipBuild

SAFETY:
    - Working directory must be clean
    - Build state documented before/after each merge
    - Automatic rollback on new build errors
    - All operations logged for review

See MERGE_STRATEGY.md for detailed documentation.
