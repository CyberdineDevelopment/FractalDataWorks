/// <para>
/// The IFractalSchedulingService provides a high-level API for managing schedules and controlling their execution.
/// It serves as the primary entry point for applications that need to create, manage, and monitor scheduled processes.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This service abstracts the complexity of the underlying scheduler implementation while providing comprehensive
/// lifecycle management, execution control, and query capabilities for schedules.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The service follows the standard FractalDataWorks service patterns by inheriting from IFractalService and returning
/// IFdwResult types for consistent error handling and result management across the framework.
/// </para>

/// <example>
/// <code>
/// // Create a new schedule
/// var schedule = new Schedule

///     TimeZoneId = "America/New_York"
