# FractalDataWorks.Services.Data.Abstractions

A minimal abstractions library that currently contains no implementation. This project appears to be a placeholder for future data abstraction interfaces and contracts.

## Overview

This project is currently empty and contains only the basic project file structure. It is likely intended to house data abstraction interfaces, contracts, and DTOs for the FractalDataWorks services architecture.

## Current Status

**⚠️ PLACEHOLDER PROJECT**: This project currently has minimal or no implementation.

**Note**: Data abstractions are currently defined in:
- `FractalDataWorks.Data.Abstractions` - Core data abstractions including `IDataCommand`, `IDataContainer`, etc.
- Service-specific abstractions projects - Each service defines its own data command extensions

This project may be consolidated or expanded in future refactoring efforts.

The project file (`FractalDataWorks.Services.Data.Abstractions.csproj`) exists but is empty, containing only:
```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

</Project>
```

## Intended Purpose

Based on the naming convention and the FractalDataWorks architecture, this project is likely intended to contain:

- Data repository interfaces
- Service abstraction contracts
- Data transfer objects (DTOs)
- Database entity abstractions
- Query specification interfaces
- Unit of work patterns
- Data validation interfaces

## Dependencies

### Package References
None currently defined.

### Project References  
None currently defined.

## Configuration

The project file is currently empty and does not specify:
- Target framework
- Language version
- Nullable reference types
- Package references
- Project references

This suggests the project is in a placeholder state waiting for implementation.

## Code Coverage Exclusions

Since the project contains no source files, there is nothing to exclude from code coverage testing.

## Future Implementation Notes

When implementing this project, consider including:

### Repository Abstractions
```csharp
public interface IRepository<TEntity> where TEntity : class
{
    Task<TEntity?> GetByIdAsync(object id);
    Task<IEnumerable<TEntity>> GetAllAsync();
    Task<TEntity> AddAsync(TEntity entity);
    Task UpdateAsync(TEntity entity);
    Task DeleteAsync(object id);
}
```

### Unit of Work Pattern
```csharp
public interface IUnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    Task<int> SaveChangesAsync();
    Task BeginTransactionAsync();
    Task CommitTransactionAsync();
    Task RollbackTransactionAsync();
}
```

### Query Specifications
```csharp
public interface ISpecification<T>
{
    Expression<Func<T, bool>> Criteria { get; }
    List<Expression<Func<T, object>>> Includes { get; }
    List<string> IncludeStrings { get; }
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Define Target Framework**: Add appropriate target framework (likely net10.0 to match other projects)
2. **Add Project Structure**: Create folders for interfaces, models, and specifications
3. **Establish Dependencies**: Reference common packages like System.ComponentModel.Annotations
4. **Implementation Planning**: Define the abstractions needed for the broader FractalDataWorks architecture

This project is currently a placeholder and requires implementation to become functional.
