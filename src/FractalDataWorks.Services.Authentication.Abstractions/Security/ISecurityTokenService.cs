/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The security token service abstracts the complexities of token management across
/// different authentication mechanisms including JWT, API keys, OAuth2 tokens,
/// and custom token formats. It provides a unified interface for token operations
/// while supporting implementation-specific token formats and validation logic.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Key responsibilities include:
/// - Generating secure authentication tokens with appropriate claims and metadata
/// - Parsing tokens to extract authentication context information
/// - Validating token integrity, signatures, and expiration
/// - Supporting multiple token formats through pluggable implementations
/// - Ensuring cryptographic security and best practices
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The service integrates closely with IAuthenticationService and IAuthenticationContext
/// to provide end-to-end token lifecycle management from generation through validation.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// All operations return IFdwResult to provide consistent error handling and
/// success/failure semantics across the FractalDataWorks framework.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Implementations should follow security best practices including:
/// - Strong cryptographic signatures for token integrity
/// - Appropriate token expiration times
/// - Secure random number generation for token entropy
/// - Protection against timing attacks in validation
