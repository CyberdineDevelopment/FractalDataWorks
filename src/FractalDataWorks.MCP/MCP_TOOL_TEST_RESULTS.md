# Roslyn MCP Server Tool Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-09-10

## Summary
The Roslyn MCP Server has been tested with various improvements made to MSBuildWorkspace loading. While the core MCP infrastructure works correctly, there are issues with project loading that need further investigation.

## Tools Tested

### ✅ Session Management Tools (WORKING)
- **StartSession** - Successfully creates sessions
- **GetSessionStatus** - Returns session information correctly
- **GetActiveSessions** - Lists active sessions
- **EndSession** - Properly terminates sessions
- **RefreshSession** - Refreshes workspace from disk

**Note:** Sessions are created successfully but report 0 projects due to MSBuildWorkspace loading issues.

### ⚠️ Diagnostic Analysis Tools (PARTIAL)
- **GetDiagnostics** - Returns empty array (no projects loaded)
- **GetDiagnosticSummary** - Works but returns no diagnostics
- **GetFileDiagnostics** - Not tested (requires loaded projects)
- **GetAnalyzerInfo** - Not tested (requires loaded projects)
- **CheckCodeFixAvailability** - Not tested

### ❌ Virtual Editing Tools (NOT TESTED)
Requires loaded projects with documents to test:
- ApplyVirtualEdit
- ApplyMultipleVirtualEdits
- CommitChanges
- RollbackChanges
- GetPendingChanges

### ❌ Type Analysis Tools (NOT TESTED)
Requires loaded projects to test:
- FindAmbiguousTypes
- FindDuplicateTypes
- GetTypeDetails
- SearchTypes
- GetTypeStatistics

### ❌ Refactoring Tools (NOT TESTED)
Requires loaded projects to test:
- RenameSymbol
- SeparateTypesToFiles
- MoveTypeToNewFile
- ApplyCodeFix

## Issues Identified

### 1. MSBuildWorkspace Project Loading Issue
**Problem:** MSBuildWorkspace.OpenSolutionAsync() and OpenProjectAsync() return solutions/projects with 0 documents.

**Attempted Fixes:**
1. ✅ Verified MSBuildLocator is registered in Program.cs
2. ✅ Added MSBuildLocator.IsRegistered check before creating workspace
3. ✅ Added WorkspaceFailed event handler for diagnostics
4. ✅ Added workspace.Diagnostics collection checking
5. ✅ Added Configuration and Platform properties to MSBuildWorkspace.Create()
6. ✅ Added comprehensive logging throughout loading process

**Possible Root Causes:**
- MSBuild SDK resolver issues
- Missing MSBuildSDKsPath environment variable
- Version mismatch between MSBuild and .NET SDK
- Missing binding redirects in app.config
- Silent failures in project evaluation

### 2. Diagnostic Output
The enhanced diagnostics don't show any WorkspaceFailed events or Diagnostics collection errors, suggesting the workspace believes it's loading successfully but finding no content.

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Check MSBuild Environment Variables:**
   - Set MSBuildSDKsPath to `C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\[VERSION]\Sdks`
   - Set MSBuildEnableWorkloadResolver to false if needed

2. **Test with Different MSBuildLocator Registration:**
   - Try `MSBuildLocator.RegisterInstance(MSBuildLocator.QueryVisualStudioInstances().Last())`
   - Use specific MSBuild path registration

3. **Add Binding Redirects:**
   - Copy binding redirects from msbuild.exe.config to app.config

4. **Test Basic MSBuild Functionality:**
   - Create a simple test to verify MSBuild can evaluate the project file
   - Check if running from Developer Command Prompt makes a difference

5. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Consider using AdhocWorkspace with manual project/document creation
   - Implement custom project file parsing if MSBuildWorkspace continues to fail

## Working Components

Despite the project loading issues, the following components work correctly:
- MCP server infrastructure
- Tool registration and discovery
- Session management system
- Error handling and diagnostics
- Logging system

## Next Steps

1. Investigate MSBuild environment configuration
2. Test with simpler project structures
3. Consider implementing fallback loading mechanisms
4. Add more detailed MSBuild diagnostic output
5. Test on different environments/machines

## Conclusion

The Roslyn MCP Server infrastructure is functional, but the critical MSBuildWorkspace component for loading .NET solutions is not working as expected. This prevents most tools from being fully tested as they require loaded projects with documents to operate on. The issue appears to be related to MSBuild configuration or environment setup rather than the MCP implementation itself.
