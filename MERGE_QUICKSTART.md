# Quick Start: Merge Feature Branches

**For impatient developers who want to merge now, read details later.**

## TL;DR

```bash
# Option 1: Automated merge script (Bash/Git Bash)
bash merge-features.sh

# Option 2: Automated merge script (PowerShell)
.\merge-features.ps1

# Option 3: Preview first (dry run)
bash merge-features.sh --dry-run
# or
.\merge-features.ps1 -DryRun
```

That's it. The scripts handle everything.

## What Gets Merged

1. **feature/architectural-analysis** - Analysis docs
2. **feature/comprehensive-docs** - User guides
3. **feature/complete-tests** - Test improvements

**NOT merged:** feature/data-containers-future (intentionally deferred)

## Prerequisites

- Working directory must be clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Must be on `features/fractaldataworks` branch
- All feature branches must exist locally

## What the Script Does

1. **Pre-flight checks** - Verifies clean state, correct branch, all branches exist
2. **Documents build state** - Saves current error count
3. **Merges branches one-by-one** - In optimal order
4. **Verifies build after each** - Ensures no new errors
5. **Auto-rollback on failure** - If new errors appear
6. **Logs everything** - For review

## Expected Outcome

- **Zero merge conflicts** (all overlapping changes are identical)
- **Same error count** (pre-existing errors, not introduced by merges)
- **All new files present** (docs + tests)
- **~20 minutes total time**

## If Something Goes Wrong

**Merge conflict?**
```bash
# See what's conflicting
git status

# Option 1: Resolve manually
# Edit files, then:
git add <resolved-files>
git commit
# Re-run script to continue

# Option 2: Abort and investigate
git merge --abort
```

**New build errors?**
```bash
# Script will ask if you want to rollback
# Choose Yes (recommended) to undo the merge

# Or manually rollback
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**Script fails?**
```bash
# Check current state
git status
git log --oneline -5

# If in middle of merge
git merge --abort

# Start fresh
git reset --hard b1f943f  # Back to pre-merge state
```

## Manual Merge (If Scripts Don't Work)

```bash
# 1. Merge architectural analysis
git merge --no-ff feature/architectural-analysis -m "Merge feature/architectural-analysis"
dotnet build

# 2. Merge comprehensive docs
git merge --no-ff feature/comprehensive-docs -m "Merge feature/comprehensive-docs"
dotnet build

# 3. Merge complete tests
git merge --no-ff feature/complete-tests -m "Merge feature/complete-tests"
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

## After Merging

```bash
# Run tests
dotnet test

# Review what changed
git log --oneline --graph -10

# Push to remote
git push origin features/fractaldataworks

# Create PR to master
# (See MERGE_STRATEGY.md for PR template)
```

## Script Options

**Bash:**
```bash
bash merge-features.sh              # Full merge with verification
bash merge-features.sh --dry-run    # Preview without changes
bash merge-features.sh --skip-build # Skip build checks (faster, riskier)
bash merge-features.sh --help       # Show help
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\merge-features.ps1              # Full merge with verification
.\merge-features.ps1 -DryRun      # Preview without changes
.\merge-features.ps1 -SkipBuild   # Skip build checks (faster, riskier)
.\merge-features.ps1 -Help        # Show help
```

## Files Generated

After running script:
- `build-pre-merge.log` - Build state before merging
- `build-after-<branch>.log` - Build state after each merge
- `build-final.log` - Final build state

## Need More Details?

See **MERGE_STRATEGY.md** for:
- Detailed file overlap analysis
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Rollback procedures
- PR creation guide
- Branch cleanup instructions

## Emergency Contacts

If you're completely stuck:

1. Check reflog: `git reflog` (you can restore ANY previous state)
2. Read MERGE_STRATEGY.md (comprehensive troubleshooting)
3. Ask for help (with your reflog and git status output)

**Remember:** Git never loses data. Everything is recoverable via reflog.
