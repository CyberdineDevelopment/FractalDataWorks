{"display":"I want you to ultrathink and then create a FractalDataWorks.Service project template for creating a domain project. that means that the project will need the option to add generators for types, references to configuration, services, abstractions with command etc. I also want a specific Connection template which will set up a project with all of the necessary objects to create a new connection.  I want to be able to use it in either dotnet cli or visual studio and for all of the optional components (providers for example) I want them to be selectable in visual studio. I think in the case of the connections things like state machine and transaction support should be selectable on the new project wizard we can put these in the templates folder in the solution. Include messages and structured logging along with item templates (addable from new item) for a structured log file, the service which inherits from servicebase which means the servicetype and all of those goodies. the domain project would be FractalDataWorks.Service.<Domain> and the connection would be FractalDataWorks.Services.Connections.<ConnectionType> so it should flow with the rest of the projects in the platform with all of teh same standards","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759865778948,"project":"C:\\development\\github\\Developer-Kit"}
